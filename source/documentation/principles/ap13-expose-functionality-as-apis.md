## AP13 - Expose functionality for departments as APIs

**Rationale**

Automation of entire processes (including
backend) is an important driver of service
delivery efficiency. It helps with the reuse of
existing functionality in existing department
systems.

**Implication**

Any platform implemented should expose specific Government functionality as APIs. For example, platform
service of sending notifications should expose APIs for other Government systems to send notifications to citizens and get updates on the status of notifications sent.
