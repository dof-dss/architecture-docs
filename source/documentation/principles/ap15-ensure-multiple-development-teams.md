## AP15 - Ensure multi development teams can add new scenarios

**Rationale**

Platforms are not only used by multiple Government teams, but their configuration should be possible by multiple development teams to keep the implementation free of vendor lock-ins.

**Implication**

Ensure part of platform acceptance includes checks for other developer teams using the platform â€“ starting
with documentation and ending with test environments.
