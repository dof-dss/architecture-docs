## AP14 - Document extensively for developers

**Rationale**

Platforms are used by other developer teams building their systems and reusing platform capabilities. Having a well documented platform is the key for its adoption.

**Implication**

When implementing platform consider extensive documentation targeted at developers as a priority.
Consider hackathons and training sessions. Implementing COTS platforms should be considered a priority where
possible as they have documentation for developers maintained by ISVs providing the platform.
