## AP12 - Provide multi-channel support for citizens

**Rationale**

Given that citizen interaction needs to be provided over multiple interaction channels (e.g. portal and mobile), platforms need to be designed with this approach in mind and that the platform is disconnected from the citizen channel used.

**Implication**

Platform implementation should expose citizen facing functionality via APIs and queues not a specific UI.
