## AP12 - Provide multi-channel support for citizens

**Rationale**

Given that citizen interaction needs to be often provided over multiple interaction channels (e.g., portal, mobile), platforms need to be designed with this approach in mind and that the platform is disconnected
from citizen channel used.

**Implication**

Platform implementation should expose citizen facing functionality via APIs and queues, not specific UI.
