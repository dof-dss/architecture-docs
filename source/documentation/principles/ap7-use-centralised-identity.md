## AP7 - Use centralised identity / federation providers

**Rationale**

Good user experience requires users not to be prompted for user credentials multiple times and for sure not to require different credentials and accounts to access different services of the same government. This is true for both citizens accessing services and Government employees accessing systems to provide those services.

**Implication**

All citizens and business representatives should have a single identity hub securing access to all non-anonymous services provided by Government. All Government internal systems accessed by Government employees or other Government systems should use a single identity hub (single identity or federated).
