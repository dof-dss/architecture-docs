## AP3 - Manage IT service documentation and configuration centrally

**Rationale**

Having documentation and configuration maintained in a shared repository enables better understanding of services to be maintained and also allows for more openness when services need to be extendend in the future. Also the approach ensures that there is a responsible party maintaining all documentation and that it does not get lost. For guidance on the structure of what content needs to be maintained for any system/service please see Appendix.

**Implication**

Leverage DSS maintained shared configuration repository.
