## AP2 - Leverage public cloud capabilities

**Rationale**

To modernise the approach of building and hosting Government solutions, gain benefits of on-demand infrastructure provisioning and scalability and have a ready-made platform as a service component public cloud hosting should be the default choice.

**Implication**

When architecting and designing solutions to support citizen services delivery, public cloud technologies and the hosting approach should be considered the default position. This also means that hybrid solutions leveraging new public cloud capabilities while accessing existing private cloud and on-premise systems/services should be the default end-to-end model for service implementation.
