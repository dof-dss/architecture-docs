## AP10 - Leverage feature flags

**Rationale**

Often IT platforms, especially those hosting multiple services often have additions. Adopting always on and
always running approach for running a service requires these services to be added over time to a limited set of beta testers first and then to be opened. Feature flags ensure this approach.

**Implication**

Use common feature flags service provided when implementing own solutions that will evolve over time
and will have features arriving as they are adopted by back office teams.
