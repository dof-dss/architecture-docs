## AP6 - Expose APIs and queue messages

**Rationale**

One of the biggest challenges in citizen service delivery is standardised exchange of information to ensure that the same approach is used by a single service to get functionality or data from systems in different departments.

**Implication**

When building systems, or new services, expose any public functionality via APIs or queues and communicate
with other services using message queues (where possible) or API calls (where sync exchange of data
required).
