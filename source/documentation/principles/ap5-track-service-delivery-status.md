## AP5 - Track service delivery status

**Rationale**

Citizen centric service delivery means that citizens get information on status of their service delivery, they and call centre employees can see the history of previous service requests. To accomplish this, each service delivery process needs to track and share centrally information about progress of service delivery.

**Implication**

Use common service delivery history service.
