## AP4 - Track and expose usage information

**Rationale**

An important element in evolving services is learning what is working and what is not is tracking usage of the services, user behaviour patterns, platforms used to access the service. Therefore each service needs to track the usage both by anonymous as well as logged in users and expose this usage information in reports/dashboards for service owners.

**Implication**

Use the common service for tracking service and platform related events.
