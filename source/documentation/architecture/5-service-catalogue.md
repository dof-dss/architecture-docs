## Service Catalogue

![Service Catalogue Solution Architecture](/images/service-catalogue-solution-architecture.png)

Service catalogue is one of the most central components of the citizen services enablement because it
provides information not only for citizens to browse and find the required services, but also it is used to link service delivery information to subscriptions and even API/service access security information (through the profile).

Administrators manage the service catalogue through administrative UI secured using the Government
employee identity management solution. The main data types to maintain in a structured service catalogue
are provided as examples in the comment included in the diagram.

Beyond administrative functionality required to manage the catalogue, important functionality is catalogue
search that be rich and should support refiners based on taxonomies, filtering based on audiences etc.
