## AC2 - REST based APIs exchanging JSON documents are the message and document exchange approach

**Rationale**

Both public and private sector organisations are currently using REST based APIs that leverage JSON data objects as it is a lightweight approach well suited for a mobile-first world. These technically and semantically support a well defined API taxonomy for the data and functionality provided by Government.

**Implication**

Solutions exposing APIs must do so using REST and JSON.
