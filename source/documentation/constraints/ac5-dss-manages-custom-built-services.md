## AC5 - DSS manages custom built services

**Rationale**

Outsourcing custom tailored solutions to external providers causes a risk of lock-in and
limited amount of innovation by having multiple teams working on the solution over
the longer lifespan of the service.

**Implication**

DSS should manage and support custom built, tailored solutions, they should not be
outsourced as managed services. External managed services can be those that are ready-made
community services not requiring customisation only configuration.
