## AC7 - Monitoring/management should leverage a common hybrid solution

**Rationale**

Running a distributed, hybrid IT environment introduces challenges of it being
managed efficiently. Adherence to the same monitoring/management approach by all solutions is
therefore critical to ensure uninterrupted services.

**Implication**

When building new systems to support citizen services, they should use a common
hybrid monitoring and management approach defined by DSS.
