## AC4 - Centralised content management platform is Drupal

**Rationale**

NI Government has significant skills and technology investments in Drupal for
managing public and internal content management sites and their existing service catalogue.

**Implication**

Any solution component requiring content or service catalogue based functionality should be
built using Drupal. Functionality should be front-end with custom APIs to reduce risk of lock in.
