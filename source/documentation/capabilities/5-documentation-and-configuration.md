## 5. Documentation and configuration repository

**Common Elements**

Common document repository for technical documentation, source control for managing configuration and customisations of solutions, common build pipeline with support for dev/test environments.

**Reasoning**

Not having current system documentation and source a significant issue for system sustainability.
Centralised management of these assets would also enable lock-in free system development approach.
