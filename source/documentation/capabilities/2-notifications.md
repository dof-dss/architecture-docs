## 2. Notifications

**Common Elements**

Notifications service enabling any Government institution to reach citizen or business representative
via notification in a unified way.

**Reasoning**

Notification services require multiple integrations and dependency on paid services e.g. sending an SMS. Centralising service not only unifies citizen experience but offers opportunity for optimal cost of the overall service.

Gov.UK Notify already provided as centralised service that DSS can front to ensure personalised message
delivery and notification tracking.
