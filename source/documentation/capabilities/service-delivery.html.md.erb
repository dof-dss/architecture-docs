# Service Delivery Control and History Capability

## Capability Description

This capability enables control of citizen
access to all services and tracking the
history of services used/requested and
their current delivery status.
This capability is one of the foundational
elements of service delivery enabling one
place for insights into service delivery for
citizens receiving services, but also for
government (e.g., service desk) that needs to
see all interactions of citizen with government
departments when handling their request.
Also tracking information can be used to
measure service delivery quality as the
capability tracks actuals of service delivery
that can be contrasted against committed or
defined SLAs. This gives executives insights
into investment areas for future service
expansion/improvement.

## Future State Required

- Details of service delivery status
changes tracked

- Service start and status change dates, including completion
captured to enable SLA compliance measurements and optimization

- Service delivery quality/status reports for executives at
departments and government wide

- Having different SLAs for the same service delivered via
different channels (in-person, web, over phone)
